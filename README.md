## Common Steps in a Deep Learning Project

1. **Importing the necessary libraries:**
   - import libraries like Tensorflow and Keras for building neural nets.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   -preprocess the data to get it into a format which is suitable for training neural nets.

3. **Build the Model:**
   - use Tensorflow and Keras to build the model. add the required number of layers and required activation functions.

4. **Compile the model:**
   - compile the neural network to get it ready for training.

5. **Train your model:**
   - Train your model on the dataset.

6. **Evaluate the model:**
   - evaluate the model on test set and validation set and compare the accuracies on Train and Validation set.

## FAQs

### What is Deep Learning?

Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, employs neural networks to emulate human-like decision-making.

### What is Tensorflow?

Tensorflow, an open-source machine learning framework by Google, is used for building and training deep learning models.

### What are Hyperparameters?

Hyperparameters are configuration settings that control the learning process of a neural network, e.g., learning rate and batch size.

### What are Tensors?

Tensors are multi-dimensional arrays representing data in deep learning, ranging from scalars to matrices.

### What are Activation Functions?

Activation functions introduce non-linearities to neural networks. Common functions include:
- **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit):** `max(0, x)`
- **Sigmoid:** `1 / (1 + exp(-x))`
- **TanH:** `(exp(x) - exp(-x)) / (exp(x) + exp(-x))`

### What is Transfer Learning?

Transfer learning is a technique where a pre-trained model's knowledge is applied to a new, similar task, often saving time and resources.

### What is Overfitting?

Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, losing its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

### What is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)?

A CNN is a type of neural network designed for image recognition, utilizing convolutional layers to capture spatial hierarchies.
