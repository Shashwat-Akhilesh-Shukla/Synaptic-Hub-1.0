## Installation

### Tensorflow 2.0 and Keras

Ensure you have Tensorflow 2.0 and Keras installed:
```markdown
```bash
pip install tensorflow==2.0
pip install keras
```

### Google Colab Setup (Better Alternative)

For those who prefer the flexibility of Google Colab, follow these steps:
1. Open the notebook in Colab
2. Connect to a hosted runtime.
3. Run the notebook cells to execute the code.

## Common Steps in a Deep Learning Project

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Collect and preprocess your dataset.

## FAQs

### What is Deep Learning?

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that involves neural networks to simulate human-like decision-making.

### What is Tensorflow?

Tensorflow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google for building and training deep learning models.

### What are Hyperparameters?

Hyperparameters are configuration settings used to control the learning process of a neural network, such as the learning rate and batch size.

### What are Tensors?

Tensors are multi-dimensional arrays used to represent data in deep learning. They can be scalars, vectors, or matrices.

### What are Activation Functions?

Activation functions introduce non-linearities to neural networks, allowing them to learn complex patterns. Commonly used activation functions include:
- **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit):** `max(0, x)`
- **Sigmoid:** `1 / (1 + exp(-x))`
- **TanH:** `(exp(x) - exp(-x)) / (exp(x) + exp(-x))`
